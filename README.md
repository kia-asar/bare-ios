## Architecture

- **iOS**: Swift 6.0, SwiftUI, iOS 26 (main) / iOS 18 (extension)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)

- SwiftUI-first architecture
- Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL with RLS, Auth, Storage)
- JSONB for flexible payloads
- n8n for ingestion workflows
- Protocol-driven dependency injection
